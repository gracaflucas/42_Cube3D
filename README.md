	<b><i>A 3D game exploring Raycasting algorithm</i></b><br>


</div>

---
**Cube3D** is a 3D raycasting game inspired by classic titles like *Doom*. Developed as part of the 42 School curriculum, this project demonstrates the fundamentals of 3D rendering using low-level graphics techniques and raycasting algorithms in C.

## Features
- 3D environment rendering with raycasting
- Player movement and collision detection
- Textured walls for immersive gameplay

## Technologies
- **Language:** C
- **Graphics Library:** MinilibX (MLX)

> [!NOTE]  
> In accordance with the 42 School coding norms:  
> * Each function must not exceed 25 lines of code.  
> * Every variable should be declared at the top of the function and initialized on a separate line.  
> * Only allowed functions may be used—using others is considered cheating.
